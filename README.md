# basic_stat_api

API that calculate basic statistic.

this API is my own media to discover testing, modularity, and brush up my programming skill.
definitely not battle tested (yet).

```bash
# install all depedendencies
bundle install

# run test
rspec ./spec/

# run code linter
# see .rubocop.yml to see all excluded rules
bundle exec rubocop

# generate new tags file
bundle exec ripper-tags -R --extra=q .

# run server
rackup
```
